            <h2>Tired of wrinkles?</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Wrinkles are a natural process that happens with aging. We can't stop them, but we can delay them by taking care of our skin.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Aging is inevitable and it affects our body in ways that are often perceived as unattractive. Wrinkles are one of the most apparent signs of aging, 
                and they are inevitable too. But you can decrease their appearance by taking care of your skin and using anti-aging products that will 
                protect it from damage caused by the environment or lifestyle factors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The three main causes of wrinkles are: UV exposure, smoking and heredity. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Down below I have listed 3 anti-aging tips for you. Follow these and you should have no problem delaying the inevitable wrinkles caused by these factors!

                <h3>Use UV protection generously</h3>
                <p>
                    A good UV protection will not only protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays, but also help with wrinkles and skin care.
                    <br>
                    We cannot stop the aging process but we can slow it down. And this is where sunscreen comes into play. 
                    Make sure that you use it generously and continuously to avoid wrinkles and skin damage.

                <h3>Use skin care products daily</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s important that you use skin care products. Your skin becomes drier with age and you need to moisturize it regularly. 
                    <br>
                    Do this once you wake up in the morning and once before you go to bed – every day! 
                    Yes, if you want to slow down the aging process you need to do this.
